### ← README.md

That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

### ← index.html

This is the home page of the site which should have links to alll the sub pages they have created. 

### ← script.js

Most of the functions for the start of the course are contained here


### ← style.css

CSS was covered earlier in eth year so there is not as much styling as could be done here
## Term 2
We concencentrated on the <canvas> element andJavascript drawing during this term
Most of the lessons add canvasses to teh *drawing.html* page and the scripts go in the *script.js* page
